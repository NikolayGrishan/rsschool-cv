# About me
I am 20 years old. During my college years, I did an internship at Celadon development as a frontend developer. I was engaged in site layout, layout for landing in figma, solving issues with adaptability, cross-browser compatibility. At the age of 19, I tried to go abroad and work there. I have experience in interviewing. I tried to get into the Polish company Voucherify, but I did not get through due to insufficient level of English (C1 was required). I took into account the mistakes and now I am working on them. I have such qualities as: quick learning, perseverance, communication skills, teamwork. I have experience in Kanban technology. I am determined to further develop in the field of IT and work on interesting projects. I want be steep frontend developer.
